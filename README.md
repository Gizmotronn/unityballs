Asteroid Dodger is a game created in the C# programming language in the Unity editor. the object of the game is to get through different levels without being hit by an asteroid. The game is being developed by Orgzy Design & ACORD Robotics for the public. The game will be available for Windows & MacOS devices.

Following Specs recommended:
* Windows 7 or 10, or MacOS El Capitan or higher (No Linux, sorry - install a virtual box or dual boot)
* Keyboard and mouse - preferably with w,a,s,d keys working
* 4 gb of RAM or more - so no Windows XP devices

These features are required to make sure the game runs as smooth as possible.


# Levels
* Level 1 - Artifacts - collect at least 5 artifacts while avoid being hit by any asteroids
* Level 2 - Go Home - Fly across the stars back to your base, avoiding black holes and more asteroids
* Level 3 - Repair Ship - unpack red pickups that have ship parts, and drag them to the correct locations on your ship
* Level 4 - 

More levels coming soon!

# School Project
## Part 1
### State the problem
What I want to learn: I want to learn how to create a game for both computers and mobile devices. I want to learn how to code in languages such as C# and C++.

* Type of app - Computer Game
* Target audience - arcade game fans
* Needs of the user - a computer (running Windows or MacOS) with at least 1mb of storage to run the game (possibly mobile). Monitor, keyboard with w,a,s,d keys working

#### Similar Games/Apps
##### Subway Surfers
Subway Surfers is a popular mobile game developed by Kiloo for iOS and Android. The game involves dodging obstacles (trains, barriers) and collecting coins and tools such as magnets and jetpacks, while running away from an angry train condcutor. Subway surfers has an HUD (Heads-up display) located at the top of the screen, which shows your score, number of coins collected, and the amount of durability the tool has. It is a 3D game.

**Subway Surfers vs Asteroid Dodgers**
* HUD - located at top in both games

Skills I will need: I will need to know how to navigate the Unity interface and I will need to know the C# language. 

### Project Timeline
July 7: I started the Roll-A-Ball Tutorial on Unity Tutorials
July 8: I added "pickups" to the game - objects for the player to pick up
July 9: I added a move function to the game
July 10: I added scoring to the game
July 13: I finished the Roll-A-Ball tutorial
July 14: I started to deviate from the standard tutorial.  I added "asteroids", which are objects that the player needs to avoid
July 17: I added a script to the asteroids so that they will remove a point from the player's score
July 18: I downloaded a sprite from the Unity Asset store
July 19: I resized the playboard, the pick up objects and the asteroids because the spaceship sprite is much bigger than the player
July 23: I added a new move function to the spaceship, which previously could not move. I also added a script so that the scoring would work for the spaceship, which is a separate gameObject to the player (which is disabled).
July 26: Sprites added for background, surface and walls

### Type of software license
Public domain - Asteroid Dodgers will be open-source, which means that it will be free and anyone can access and edit the code, like wordpress.org. I want people to be able to add to my game.
